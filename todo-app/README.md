# ToDo List App

On the app you can add, edit, or delete ToDo's from a ToDo list. The app can only be used if you're signed in to a Google account.

### How the App Works

You can sign in to your Google account by clicking the 'Sign In with Google' button on the top right corner of the page. You can sign out by clicking the same button, which by then will have in it the text: 'Sign Out'. In the input field, the user can type in the ToDo's and add them to the list by either pressing the 'Enter' key or by clicking the 'Add' button. Whenever a ToDo gets added, the input field will be cleared. If the user submits an empty input field, no ToDo's will be added to the list and an error message will be displayed on the page. Each item from the list has three different buttons. The blue check mark button, whenever clicked, will add a line through the ToDo; indicating that the ToDo was completed. The yellow note button, when clicked, redirects you to a page where the Todo in which the clicked button was, can be edited/updated. When you click the 'Update' button, you will be redirected to the home page where the list of ToDo's is displayed. The update to the ToDo will be reflected on the page. The red trash button, when clicked, deletes the ToDo.
